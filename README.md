# OPT_FOR_DS_PROJ
In this project, i have solved an optimization problem for a given function using several different methods.
The project consists of two part: in the first part, a dataset generated by the rand() function was used, while
in the second part a dataset from the web was used.
In both parts the optimization problem was solved using the three follow methods: GRADIENT DESCENT, BLOCK COORDINATE GRADIENT DESCENT with RANDOMIZED RULE
and BLOCK COORDINATE GRADIENT DESCENT with GS (GAUSS-SOUTHWELL) RULE.
Obviusly in the colab file the results are shown through graphs and tables.
